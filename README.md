# odin_landing_page_Project
-   This project imitates the sample project image provided by odin project. 
-   That image is tried to be imitated exactly for maximized practice.
-   There might be a little changes here & there but overall its felt pretty solid.
-   Tried to make it look solid on mobile views by some css & flexbox workarounds but odin said something about tackle it later. So...leaving it at that.
-   For this project, html, css & flexbox are used only.
